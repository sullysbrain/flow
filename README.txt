# Flow - Project Tracking and Data Analysis Tool

The purpose of Flow is to track multiple projects through their lifetime and visualize the data to find efficiencies and inefficiencies of each project to help alleviate bottlenecks.

Data Object structures:

    - Project
        - Creation date
        - Phases
            - Phase names
            - Estimated timeline for each Phase
